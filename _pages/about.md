Master's graduate of Astrophysics from the University of Copenhagen, specialising in analysing astronomical data from both simulations and observations. Through my studies, I have developed strong skills in Python programming, data analysis, and scientific visualisation, working with large and complex datasets to uncover patterns and insights.

I am passionate about using data to explore and understand complex systems - whether it’s the evolution of galaxies in the early universe or challenges here on Earth. Beyond science, I’m a creative problem-solver who enjoys finding innovative ways to communicate results and tell stories through data.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss data analysis, astrophysics, or creative approaches to solving problems.
